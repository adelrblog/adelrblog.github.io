``What is tagging? Just how much of tagging do we need? How much is enough? Are we doing it wrong?``

tagging is the process of identifying and marking segments in a language corpus whether it's spoken or text. 

Most corpora like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus">Brown Corpus</a> have POS tagging (Part-Of-Speech Tagging). These corpora have only one purpose and they fulfil that purpose well. What I have in mind is multilayer tagging of the corpora. This is accomplished by having the corpus and annotations in different layers. For instance consider the following example:

This multilayer propose can help us annotate and view different parts of corpora.

I'm currently working on this proposal.

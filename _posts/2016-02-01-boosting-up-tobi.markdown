So I was Thinkin about <b>ToBI</b>'s weaknesses in showing several Phonetic features such as frequency difference, timing etc. This comes handy when you are analyzing features like Delayed Peak. This in particular needs a lot of readings. The top book in my reading list is:
<li>Gussenhoven, Carlos. The phonology of tone and intonation. Cambridge University Press, 2004.</li>

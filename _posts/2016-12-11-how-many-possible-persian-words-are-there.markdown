Possible word combination of Persian

The syllable structure of Persian is CVCC meaning it can have one (C)onsonant following a (V)owel and two consonants. Persian has 23 consonants and 6 vowels. The minimum number of vowels and consonants a syllable can have is one vowel. 
The Persian syllable structure can be: 
(C), (C)(V), (C)(V)(C), (C)(V)(C)(C) 
Which gives us:
6 + (23*6) + (23*6*23) + (23*6*23*23) =
76320
This is only the possibility of occurring monosyllabic words.
For a bisyllabic word we have: 
76320**2 = 5824742400
For a trisyllabic word we have:
76320**3 = 444544339968000
Biggest word I could find in Persian is:
اطمينان آفرينترين
Which has 8 syllables which gives us:
1151083672073888342219211512217600000000
1.151084E+39

As you might know I'm building the first online school for linguistics courses in teachable platform (<a href="http://glot.teachable.com">Glot home</a>) I'm really working hard on courses like "statistical methods in phonology" and "LING101". Both are completely free. 

The general linguistics course is going to cover most aspects of linguistics and can serve as a general introduction on linguistics. I have recently finnished builing the curriculum of the course (despite the fact that I have my graduate university entrance exam in 2 month!). In general I Hope this course could be helpful to students who are looking forward to an introduction on linguistics. I will post more updates on the course.

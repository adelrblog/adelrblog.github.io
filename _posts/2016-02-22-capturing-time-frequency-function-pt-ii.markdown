title: Capturing Time Frequency Function pt. II

In the previous post I tried to introduce a function of duration and frequency. after some thoughts I decided to work on two fundamental questions:

<b> a) </b> The Aim

 <b> b) </b> The process

**The Aim** of this scale and the whole transcription is to provide a hybrid model of intonation transcription which is suitable for both computational processing and human transcription (I will soon do a detailed analysis of existing intonational models),

**The process** is rather tricky. In the beginning I would really wanted to work on the ToBI system. It's **fast**, it's ** easy to read** and finally it's **easy to implement**. The thing about ToBI is that it's not quite...you know...right. what I mean is that the ToBI system throws off a tremendous amount of prosodic data that we can't quite say we don't need.
